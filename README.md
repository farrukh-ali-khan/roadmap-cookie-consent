# Cookie Consent Popup

This project is designed to introduce basic DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript. The goal is to create a simple cookie consent popup that appears when the user visits the page. The popup includes a message and a button to accept the consent. Once accepted, the popup disappears. The consent is persisted using local storage to prevent the popup from appearing on subsequent visits.

## Features

- Displays a cookie consent banner on page load.
- Users can accept the consent by clicking the "Accept" button.
- Consent is stored in `localStorage` to prevent repeated popups for the same user.
- Includes a **Close (X)** button for dismissing the popup manually.
- Fully responsive design.
